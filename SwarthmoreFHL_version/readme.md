# Background
The Dictionary of Quaker Biography was compiled jointly by the Library of the Religious Society of Friends in London and Haverford College Quaker Collection between the 1950s and 1980s. It consists of approximately 20,000 biographical entries on prominent British and American Friends from the 17th through the 20th centuries and amounts to about 32,000 typescript pages. For more on the history of the project, see Edwin B. Bronner, “Dictionary of Quaker Biography,” _Quaker History_ 54, no. 1 (1965): 45.

# Copies
There are two &quot;original copies,&quot; one located at Haverford and the other at Friends House Library, London. Friends Historical Library (FHL) at Swarthmore College has a photocopy of the Haverford &quot;copy.&quot; However, all copies differ significantly from each other, due to the accrual of notes on each copy and the addition and weeding of entries after copies were made.

# This Index
In 2021, longtime FHL volunteer James Hazard indexed the copy of the DQB held at Swarthmore. The project was intended to supplement a project then under consideration at Haverford to make the entirety of their DQB copy available online. However, recognizing that the index is a useful resource in its own right, FHL has decided to make it available independently.

# Selection Criteria
Most Friends do not have DQB entries. The focus, at least among North American Quakers, was on ministers and others for whom memorials were published. Again, see Bronner&#39;s article in _Quaker History_ for more details.
