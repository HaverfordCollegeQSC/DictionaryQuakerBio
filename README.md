# DictionaryQuakerBio

The Dictionary of Quaker Biography is a compilation of two sources - one biography from Frends House Library, London, and the other from Haverford College Quaker & Special Collections.

For the Friends House Library entries, several thousand entries were prepared from sources including: A Collection of Testimonies, the Annual Monitor, Piety Promoted, TLÂ· Friend (London), and biographical notices in such volumes as the Cambridge Journal of George Fox, the Shorter Journal, and Pen Pictures of London Yearly Meeting. The Haverford College Quaker & Special Collections entries were created by William Bacon Evans who selected Friends who made "outstanding" contributions to Quakerism, whether in religion, education, science, art, or industry. These includes many of the authors listed in Smith's Descriptive Catalogue of Friends Books, those mentioned in Besse's Collection of the People Called Quakers, and those mentioned in memorials of American yearly meetings, periodicals, and more. Both of these dictionaries include references or sources of more information for more entrants.

In the early 1960s, it was decided to bring these two dictionaries together, with one full set at Haverford and one at Friends House Library. In 1965, Edwin Bronner wrote on these dictionaries: "They are tentative in nature and must be used with caution, but scholars from both sides of the Atlantic have been very enthusiastic about the value of the project." There is a third copy, being at Friends Historical Library at Swarthmore College. This is a photocopy of the Haverford one. All three versions are differ significantly from each other, due to the accrual of notes on each copy and the addition and weeding of entries after copies were made.

This is a living document which has evolved over time. It is incomplete, and may contain errors.

In this Git, you will find two items:
1. An accurate but incomplete index of Friends Historical Library's copy, compiled by James Hazard
2. Approximately 130 OCR'd PDFs, produced using an automated process so there are some errors introduced that way (pages skipped, inaccurate OCR)
