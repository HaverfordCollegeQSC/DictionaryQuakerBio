Holding OCR'd Dictionary of Quaker Biography (DQB) materials

There are two "original copies," one located at Haverford College and the other at Friends House Library, London. Friends Historical Library (FHL) at Swarthmore College has a photocopy of the Haverford "copy." However, all three copies differ significantly from each other, due to the accrual of notes on each copy and the addition and weeding of entries after copies were made.

This repository holds the Haverford College OCR'd DQB, organized by alphabetical volume.
