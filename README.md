# DictionaryQuakerBio

The Dictionary of Quaker Biography is a compilation of two sources - one biography from Library of the Society of Friends, London, and the other from Haverford College Quaker & Special Collections.

For the Library of the Society of Friends entries, several thousand entries were prepared from sources including _A Collection of Testimonies_, _the Annual Monitor_, _Piety Promoted_, _The Friend_ (London), and biographical notices in such volumes as the Cambridge _Journal of George Fox_, the _Shorter Journal_, and _Pen Pictures of London Yearly Meeting_. The Haverford College Quaker & Special Collections entries were created by William Bacon Evans, who selected Friends who made "outstanding" contributions to Quakerism, whether in religion, education, science, art, or industry. These includes many of the authors listed in Smith's _Descriptive Catalogue of Friends Books_, those mentioned in Besse's _Collection of the People Called Quakers_, those with biographies in Amelia Mott Gummere's edition of John Woolman's _Journal_, and those mentioned in memorials of American yearly meetings, periodicals, and more. Both dictionaries include references or sources of more information for most entries.

These two dictionaries were brought together in the early 1960s, with one full set at Haverford and one at FLibrary of the Society of Friends. In 1965, Edwin Bronner wrote on these dictionaries: "They are tentative in nature and must be used with caution, but scholars from both sides of the Atlantic have been very enthusiastic about the value of the project."[^1] 

A third copy is held at Friends Historical Library at Swarthmore College, and is a photocopy of the Haverford one. In 2021, longtime FHL volunteer James E. Hazard indexed the copy of the DQB held at Swarthmore. The project was intended to supplement a project then under consideration at Haverford to make the entirety of their DQB copy available online. However, recognizing that the index is a useful resource in its own right, FHL has decided to make it available independently.

All three versions differ significantly from each other, due to the accrual of notes on each copy and the addition and weeding of entries after copies were made.

This is a living document which has evolved over time. It is incomplete and may contain errors.

In this GitHub Repository, you will find two items:
1. An index of Friends Historical Library's copy, compiled by James E. Hazard.
2. Approximately 130 PDFs of the Quaker & Special Collections' copy. The scanning and OCR were done using an automated process that has introduced some errors (pages skipped, inaccurate OCR, etc.).
